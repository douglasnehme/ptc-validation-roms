abstract = {In August 2008, the National Geophysical Data Center (NGDC), an office of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) developed the ETOPO1 1 Arc-Minute Global Relief Model as an improvement to the ETOPO2v2 Global Relief Model. ETOPO1 is available in Ice Surface (top of Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets; Fig. 1) and Bedrock (base of the ice sheets; Fig. 2) versions. Both versions of ETOPO1 were generated from diverse global and regional digital data sets (coverage shown in Figs. 3 and 4), which were shifted to common horizontal and vertical datums, and then evaluated and edited as needed. This report provides a summary of the data sources and methodology used in developing ETOPO1.},
